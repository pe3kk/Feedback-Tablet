Successfully implemented a feedback tablet using MQTT, SQL database, Flask API, and a ReactJS web app to gather customer satisfaction and visualize the data in real-time. The end result was a pre-configured package that included the setup of the new network and its components, as well as the feedback device. This system can be easily scaled up to include multiple capture devices and has a focus on ease of deployment, security, and scalability.
